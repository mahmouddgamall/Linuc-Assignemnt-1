# Linuc-Assignemnt-1

This repository includes the 2 assignments that we were asked to deliver. The first one is a Phonebook and the other one is the safe delete which I have called it "mytrash".

f1.txt is the data base for the phonebook.

for "mytrash" to work, make sure that you have a folder in your home directory that is called TRASH, otherwise the code will 
not behave correctly.

I wish that this codes had  everything you need, please let me know if you needed further functionality in your assignment.
